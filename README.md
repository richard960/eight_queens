### Project Info
Created an algorithm to figure out how to put 8 queens on a chess board without any conflicts.\
We keep looping through the array to see if a queen can be placed.\
If not check previous rows and move a queen if possible.\
The algorithm will continue to do this until it can find a peice to place.
